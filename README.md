# React Template

This is a React template project for quickly starting a new project with a pre-configured development environment. It uses the following tools:

- React
- React Router
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hugohutri/react-template.git
cd react-template
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

## Building

To build the production version of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and create a production-ready build in the dist directory.

## Previewing the Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build from the dist directory and open it in your default browser.
